Pretty much every one heard the term before. It turns out that close to 3% of the population in developed countries is
estimated to have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Most of those cases are, of course, undiagnosed. In the last
few years, I've been finding myself connecting a lot with the experience of people who are diagnosed with ADHD. I am not
diagnosed, but those shared experiences make me strongly suspect that I might have ADHD too. This gave me an interesting
opportunity to talk about dealing with ADHD at work, and accommodating for ADHD people is actually accommodating for all.

## What ADHD feels like
First, let make sure that we are all on the same page. While ADHD can sometimes make you feel like a super-hero, that's
not what usually happens. ADHD is a spectrum. Some people will have much stronger symptoms than others. Some people will
have an easier time to mask, or hide those symptoms from the people around them, than others. Some people will see their
symptoms triggers over different things. It's a complicated condition, and it expresses itself in many nuanced ways.

At the core of ADHD is a battle between your ability to focus, and your inability to stop focussing. If you want to see
the world through the eyes of someone with ADHD, you can try a little exercise: Pick a simple social interaction you had
today. It can be with your barista at the coffee shop, with your significant other at a bus stop, with a complete
stranger in the subway, or even with your dog at home. Try to recall a small detail about this interaction. Maybe it was
the smell of the coffee, the shimmer in their eyes, the funny beanie they were wearing, or the mess that they made out of
your potted plants. You're laughing, aren't you? Come on, I know you are. Maybe the interaction wasn't nice at the time,
but recalling it just feels silly now. Maybe you noticed that the coffee smelled more floral than usual and now want to
ask more about it, or how much you're blushing thinking about how they make your feel, or how maybe you caught yourself
judging people for their looks, or noticed how you over-reacted and the plants are going to be just fine.

Breathe in, breathe out...

That was a good 3 minutes, wasn't it? Now imagine if that whole 3 minutes happened right then, at that moment. How would
have that changed your interaction? How would have they reacted if they caught you breathing deeply near the coffee
grinder for 3 minutes. How would they have reacted if you just phased out blushing wildly and missed the bus you were
waiting for. How would they have reacted if they noticed you actually did comment on their hat out-loud for 3 minutes.
How confused your dog would be if you'd just yelled at them for a while and then... snuggled and pet them for 3 minutes
in the dirt.

3 minutes went by, and you just missed it. You managed to hyper-focus on a little something, while looking completely
distracted from the outside. Thankfully, this is just a blog, and you can come back to this moment, right now, without
effort. If you had ADHD, you might still be hyper-focussing on this moment. You might have already watched the entire
back catalog of James Hoffman on YouTube as you just got absolutely absorbed by how coffee can smell so different
sometimes...

## What ADHD feels like for a software developer
Three months ago, I was spending some time on my personal project. It's an idea that I had for years now, and I've been
working hard for a long time to try and get it to a point where I can actually sell it. Hopefully, it will bring me some
passive income one day, and if I'm lucky, give me a full time job.

Three months ago, I noticed that Azure Search didn't offer an emulator for their service that I could use to develop
locally, so I decided to build a small mock in my project, and then I learned how that wouldn't work because I needed
facets, and then I learned how that wouldn't work because I needed to simulate their paging interface, and then I
noticed that I needed to support their OData protocol to query for specific pages, and then I learned there's a complete
custom syntax for filtering search queries they documented in EBNF, and then I learned about EBNF, the multitudes of
variants, and which one they were using, and then I learned about parser generation and how I could turn this EBNF into
an actual parser with Jison, and then I learned it didn't worked because their grammar wasn't LALR(1), and then...

Well... You know... :)

For us, that little exercise took 3 minutes. For me, that took 3 months, but boy do I feel like a super-hero now!

I'm just lucky this didn't happen on a time crunch in a company that had a contractual obligation to ship this project
in a few weeks. Then, I might have felt awful for months and might have even lost my job. It's a real battle. Sometimes
you want to move on, but your brain will just constantly nag you at 3 am because you just got it, and now you can get
just a bit further, and maybe it might be just enough to succeed.

If you think that sounds awful, wait until I tell you how I nearly removed TypeScript from that same project because I
couldn't get a specific type to work for weeks and it made me feel worthless and depressive.

## And Scrum can help?
Yeah! When it's done right, Scrum can do a lot of good for people with ADHD. By trying to change how we think about
project management, it tackles distractions and focus from multiple different angles. A big part of Scrum is about
"shielding the team" from outside interference. This is the role of the Product Owner's responsibility, together with
principles like having a fixed goal for the sprint. Another part is how it tries to produce measurable outcomes. This is
necessary to stay empirical in your process. If the sprint length, or team members changes all the time, then you always
measure multiple variable at once which makes it exponentially more difficult to measure the success rate of your
process. The outcome is predictability; something ADHD people will cherish deeply.
