## Assignment - Thinking Like a Machine

As in any course, you will have assignments to complete between each sessions. Those assignments are not mandatory. You can skip them if you want. They are only here to help you go through some of the principles we have seen in the previous sessions. I will always share my own answer at the end of the post to help you compare your results with mine. There are are always multiple answers to a problem so do not consider mine as absolute. They are only guidelines and might get updated as time goes.

If you would like me to personally review your answers, feel free to contact me anyway you like (Google+, Twitter, comments on this post or any other way you can find) and I will do my best to get back in touch with you.

Today’s assignment is a fairly easy one. Doors are everywhere. Your room, your house, your car, elevators, garages, etc. You are used to opening, closing, locking and unlocking them everyday. Maybe even bumping in them some times! If you had to program a robot to open your front-door, (1) what would be the logical steps required to complete this task successfully for every possible cases and (2) what would be the objects, properties and actions involved in those tasks. Be as detailed as possible. Do not hesitate to use Google if your knowledge of doors or robots is not to your liking.

Hints

1. Try to think about every possible scenarios. Be creative. If you feel stuck, go open a door by yourself and think about everything you do and everything the door is doing.
2. Well obviously, you have a Door and a Robot but what else?
3. Think about the properties and actions of the door before the ones of your robot. It will help you get a better understanding of the problem before you try to solve it.

For now, this answer covers basic and sliding doors that cannot or can be unlocked. Do not hesitate to submit corrections if you find issues or find ways to improve it.
